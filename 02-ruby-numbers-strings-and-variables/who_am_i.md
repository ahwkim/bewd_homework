Who am I?
========

Our job is to write a program that will ask us:

* our name
* where we grew up
* current occupation
* hidden talent

Once the program has taken in this information, output a string which contains each attribute. 

Example:

```
My name is Bobby Matson, I grew up in Millis, MA. I currently work as a software engineer and I play the drums.
```

BONUS:

Make sure everything is lower case. So if the user enters `ROBERTA` make sure the program outputs `roberta`.
