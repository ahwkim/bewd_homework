#Animal Sounds

Write a program that does the following:

1. Ask the user for the name of an animal makes an animal sound. Tell the user what they entered.

2. Ask the user what the animal sound is that their animal makes. Tell the user what they entered.

3. Put a sentence that describes the animal making their animal sound three times. For example: `The duck goes quack quack quack`.

Example:

```
Enter an animal that makes a sound:
chicken
What sound does a chicken make?
cluck
The animal goes cluck cluck cluck
```

BONUS 1

Make sure the animal's name and the sound are always lower-case

BONUS 2

Ensure there is always one space between each animal sound, even if the user enters no spaces or multiple spaces.

BONUS 3

Instead of always 3 times, allow the user to change the number of times the animal sound is made.

BONUS 4

Separate the animal sounds with commas like so: `The animal goes cluck, cluck, cluck`. Make sure you don't have an extraneous comma on the end of the sentence.
