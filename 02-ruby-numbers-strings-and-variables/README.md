##Introduce Numbers

Let's create a new file called `numbers.rb`. Inside of there, let's go ahead and play with some numbers.

```
5
5.0
```

We'd think of those as the same thing, but in Ruby their actually two different thing.


##Use operators +, -, *, /, %



##Lab - Using Integers

- Calculate your age in seconds
- How years are in 87786 days?

##String addition

'Hello my name is ' + 'Greg Buckner'
