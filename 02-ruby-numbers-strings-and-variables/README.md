##Lab - Using Integers

- Calculate your age in seconds
- How many years are in 87786 days?
- Is that round? How many days are left over?

##Lab - Playing with Strings

- Try putting this string with both single quotes and double quotes: `You're the best`
- What happened?

##Lab - Using Variables

- Create a new ruby file called `variables.rb`. In that file, write code that outputs the following when you run it:

    ```
      This is repetitive...
      This is repetitive...
      ...I'm glad I'm lazy!
      ...I'm glad I'm lazy!
      This is repetitive...
    ```

    You can only create those two strings once. Use variables.
