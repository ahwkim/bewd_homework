#Extra Practice
---

If you want extra practice, spend time going through the following exercises:

* **Apartment Decision Maker** Write a program for deciding whether I should move into an apartment or not. The program should ask me questions then give me a yes or no.

    I will move into an apartment if rent is less than 1/3 of my monthly income, and it has at least 1 bathroom per 1.5 bedrooms but no more than 5 bedrooms.

* **Days of the Month** Write a program that outputs the numbers of all the months which have 31 days (as in April is the 4th month, or number 4). 

    The rule of thumb is: Every other month has 31 days, starting in January. But, July and August break the rule because both have 31 days. After August, though, the pattern of every other continues (you can see here too if my description is hard to follow: http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/months/).

    Put another way: For months below or equal to 7, odd months have 31 days. After the 7th month (July), even months have 31 days.

* **FizzBuzz** Write a program that prints the integers from 1 to 100.

    But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
    
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
