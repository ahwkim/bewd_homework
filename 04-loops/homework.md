Read [Chapter 6: Flow Control](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_06.html) from Chris Pine's Learn to Program. Try the examples yourself as you read the chapter.

After reading, complete all of the following challenges:

* **99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall** Write a program that outputs the song. Example:

    ```
    99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
    Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

    98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
    Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

    ... REMOVED FOR BREVITY ...

    1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
    Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.

    No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. 
    Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
    ```

* **Leap Years** Write a program which will ask for a starting year and an ending year, and then puts all of the leap years between them (and including them, if they are also leap years). 

    Leap years are years divisible by four (like 1984 and 2004). However, years divisible by 100 are not leap years (such as 1800 and 1900) unless they are divisible by 400 (like 1600 and 2000, which were in fact leap years).

* **Deaf Grandma** Write a Deaf Grandma program. Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with  HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!, unless you shout it (type in all capitals). 

    If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, NO, NOT SINCE 1938! To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950.

    You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout BYE.
