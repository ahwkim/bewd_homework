* Lab - Pants Forecast

##Lab - Pants Forecast
---

Build a Sinatra app that does the following:

1. Ask the user what Zipcode they are in.
2. Once they submit their Zipcode, tell them whether today is a Pants Day or a Shorts Day.
3. Also include the temperature high and low.

Things to keep in mind:

* This is a multi-page Sinatra app. You decide the names of the pages and how they work.
* You can get weather here: https://developer.forecast.io/
* You or your partner will need to register for Forecastio. Then you need to include your API key in your URL when you request the weather.
* Shorts Day - When the high is above 74 F.
