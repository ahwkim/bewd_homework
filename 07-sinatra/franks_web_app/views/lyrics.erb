Merry month of may, sunny skies of blue,
clouds have rolled away and the sun peeps thru,
May express happiness, joy you may define in a thousand ways,
but a case like mine needs a 'special phrase' 
to reveal how I feel.

I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow,
Got the string around my finger,,
What a world, what a life, I'm in love!
I've got a song that I sing,

I can make the rain go, anytime I move my finger,
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love,
Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string,
I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go,

I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow,
Got the string around my finger, 
What a world, what a life, I'm in love.
